A Unitary Framework for Universal Information Conservation via Euler-Complex Phase Transitions
# The Tasar Cycle

**A Universal Information Conservation Framework**
*by Semih TAŞAR*

## 🌌 Overview

The **Tasar Cycle** is a theoretical framework designed to address the long-standing tension between **quantum unitarity** and **general relativity**. Instead of assuming information loss at spacetime singularities, the model proposes that information is **conserved through representational transitions** across a cyclic, three-phase structure.

This repository provides:

* A concise theoretical description of the Tasar Cycle
* Mathematical definitions of the representational transitions
* A Python-based quantum simulation illustrating the model

## 🔁 The Three-Phase Cycle

Information evolves through a closed loop of representations:

### Phase I — Spacetime (ST)

* Information is encoded geometrically
* Representation space: **real-valued spacetime** (\mathbb{R})
* Classical and relativistic descriptions are valid

### Phase II — Space–Light (SL)

* Information density reaches saturation
* Acts as a **threshold regime**
* No further compression is possible without changing representation

### Phase III — Light–Time (LT)

* Information rotates into a **complex representation**
* Representation space: (\mathbb{C})
* Governed by Euler’s identity (e^{i\pi})
* Enables unitary preservation under extreme conditions

The cycle closes when information is re-projected back into spacetime.

## 📐 The Tasar Constant ((\Lambda_T))

The representational transition is governed by an emergent scale parameter:

[
\Lambda_T = \frac{h}{k_B e} \approx 1.77 \times 10^{-11}; \text{s}\cdot\text{K}
]

**Interpretation:**
(\Lambda_T) marks the upper bound at which a physical system can be described purely by real-valued geometry. Beyond this threshold, a complex (unitary) representation becomes necessary.

## 💻 Implementation

The core simulation is implemented in **Python**.

### Main Module

```
tasar_quantum_core.py
```

### Core Methods

* **Wick Rotation**:
  Maps linear time to imaginary time via (t \to it)

* **Information Saturation Modeling**:
  Landauer-inspired marginal relations for information gain

* **Unitary Phase Shielding**:
  Preserves quantum states by rotation into complex space

* **Feedback Mechanism**:
  Simulates re-projection into spacetime, offering a candidate interpretation of **Dark Energy**

## 📡 Empirical Implications

The Tasar Cycle yields testable predictions for gravitational-wave observatories:

* **Gravitational-Wave Echoes**
  Weak deviations during the ringdown phase of black hole mergers

* **Quantitative Estimate**
